I am a postgraduate researcher in the SIGMA Lab, Faculty of Information Science and Engineering at Ocean University of China, working under the guidance of Professor Yanwei Yu. My academic interests center on optimizing the Age of Information (AoI), with a particular focus on applying reinforcement learning methodologies to support intelligent decision-making and enhance overall system efficiency.
