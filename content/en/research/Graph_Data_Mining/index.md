Graph Data Mining focuses on discovering frequent and meaningful subgraph patterns (e.g., network motifs) from large-scale temporal graphs. It involves designing highly scalable and parallelizable algorithms to enable efficient mining and analysis of massive temporal graphs on modern multi-core computing architectures.
