This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic analytics framework through three integrated components: (1) mining spatiotemporal patterns of congestion propagation in road networks using big data to identify critical influencing factors and inter-road correlations; (2) constructing a graph neural network-based prediction system with multi-source data fusion for real-time traffic forecasting; (3) establishing a policy evaluation mechanism that assesses public transport performance across accessibility, reliability, and equity dimensions while quantifying policy impacts on congestion mitigation and efficiency improvement. The research will generate both predictive tools for traffic management and evidence-based policy recommendations for sustainable urban mobility.
