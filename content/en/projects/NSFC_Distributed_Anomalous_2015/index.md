This project has carried on the thorough research of distributed outlier detection and trajectory pattern mining for spatiotemporal trajectory big data. First, we proposed a class of novel neighbor-based trajectory stream outlier model, which takes the different semantics of spatiotemporal neighbors and effectively captures various anomalous events in different scenarios. Second, we completed a series of efficient clustering algorithms and density-based clustering for streaming big data, and implemented the evolving clustering analysis in spatiotemporal data streams. Third, we designed a load-balanced data partition method in distributed stream processing system for spatiotemporal big data. Finally, we also completed the mining of trajectory group patterns based on cluttering for high-volume trajectory streams, and further realized the parallel algorithm design for distributed spatiotemporal trajectory pattern mining.
