This project initiative aims to develop an innovative pre-trained spatiotemporal representation learning model to address three critical applications of spatiotemporal data mining: (1) traffic flow prediction in intelligent transportation systems, (2) location recommendation in location-based social networks (LBSN), and (3) hydrological forecasting in marine science. The project will focus on establishing an effective deep learning framework based on large-scale pre-trained models for spatiotemporal representation learning, while systematically investigating and validating the model's effectiveness across these diverse application domains.
