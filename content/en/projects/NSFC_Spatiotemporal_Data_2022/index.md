This project plans to conduct an in-depth study on representation learning for large-scale spatiotemporal data and its applications. First, we will build an effective representation learning framework with the exploration of spatiotemporal data from different dimensions. Then, we target at five different real-world applications for our evaluation of spatial-temporal representation learning frameworks, i.e., trajectory-user linking, trajectory prediction, location recommendation, relationship inference, and trajectory anomaly detection. Specifically, we will design customized deep learning models for these applications within their unique spatial-temporal context.
