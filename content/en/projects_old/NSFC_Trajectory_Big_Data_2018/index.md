This project selects spatiotemporal trajectory big data as the research object, and conducts in-depth research on the semantic-integrated trajectory data pattern mining and anomaly detection technologies. For mobility relationship inference integrating semantic features, this project proposes a friend relationship inference model based on graph embedding, which introduces semantics such as POI categories into meeting events, effectively improving the inference performance of friend relationship. For important location inference based on traffic big data, this project proposes an accurate home location and work area inference method, which realizes the annotation of important locations on sparse vehicle trajectories. For traffic inference based on traffic big data, this project completed a series of studies on citywide traffic volume inference, from spatiotemporal semi-supervised model to traffic simulator model, and to spatiotemporal representation learning model, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. For high-efficiency anomaly detection, this project 
proposes a fast Top-n local anomaly detection algorithm. Aiming at the problem of local anomaly detection in streaming big data environment, a Top-n local outlier detection method based on kernel density estimation is designed, which realizes efficient and effective Top-n local outlier detection in streaming big data. For the anomaly detection of high-dimensional data, this project proposes a layer-constrained variational auto-encoding kernel density estimation model and an autoregressive flow-based anomaly detection model.
